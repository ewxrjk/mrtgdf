mrtgdf
======

A caching disk usage monitor that outputs in the format required by
MRTG.  SNMP doesn't seem to be able to provide a stable identity for
removable disks, hence this program.

    autoreconf -is

In any case:

    fakeroot debian/rules clean build binary
    sudo dpkg -i ../mrtgdf_*.deb

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
